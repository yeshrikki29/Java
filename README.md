# Java Logical Programs

#### Welcome to the world of Java logical programs! In this repository,you'll find a collection of programs that test your logical reasoning skills and help you improve your problem-solving abilities.

## ***Installation***

To run the programs in this repository, you'll need to have **Java** installed on your machine. You can [download](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) and [install](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) the latest version of Java from the [official website.](https://www.java.com)

Once you have Java installed, simply [clone this repository](https://github.com/yeshrikki29/java-logical-programs.git) to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/yeshrikki29/java-logical-programs.git`

>To run a specific program, navigate to the directory where the program is located and compile the Java file using the following command:

`javac ProgramName.java`

>Replace ProgramName with the name of the Java file you want to compile. Once the file is compiled, you can run the program using the following command:

`java ProgramName`

>Again, replace ProgramName with the name of the Java file you want to run.
## **Program List**
